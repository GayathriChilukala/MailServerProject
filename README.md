# Email Communication with SSL and CRC Implementation

This project, undertaken as part of the CSE302: Computer Networks course, focuses on building a system for sending and accessing emails with enhanced security and data integrity.

## Key Features:

* **Secure Email Transmission:** Implements the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) authentication to ensure secure transmission of emails.
* **Email Access via IMAP:** Enables users to access and manage their emails using the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).
* **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):** Integrates a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) program to detect accidental changes or corruption of raw data during transmission or storage. This helps ensure data integrity.

## Technical Details:

The project likely involves the use of Java, as indicated by the reference to the JavaMail API. It demonstrates the practical application of network protocols and error detection techniques.

## Future Enhancements (Planned):

* Sending emails to multiple recipients.
* Attaching more than one file to an email.
* Implementing file encryption and decryption for enhanced security.
* Adding a delete option for managing emails.
